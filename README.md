A whole lotta weasels
======

A joint effort to write the [Dawkins' Weasel algorithm][wikipedia] in as many languages as possible, using the language's specific idioms.

Algorithm described [here][algorithm].

+ Each implementation should only be one file and placed in the root folder.
+ Each file should be named by the language in which it was written.
+ The program should print the fittest string of each generation, as well as the number of generations it took.
